# Luogu-Spider-Frontend
This is the frontend of my 2nd assignment of 2023 SE.
This **won't** work independently.

# Setup
You need to run `npm run build` and put the all the files in `\dist\` folder to the `\resources\static` folder of my backend project, and run install command in maven to build a jar file.
